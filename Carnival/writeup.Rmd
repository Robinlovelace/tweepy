## Introduction

The West Indian Carnival takes place in late August each year in Leeds, attracting tens of
thousands of people to Chapeltown, a multi-cultural area to the north of the city centre.
In 2014 the event was held from the 17^th^ until the 25^th^ of August.

This report investigates what social media data might be able to tell us about the event,
above and beyond official estimates of the turnout.

## The data

As a baseline dataset, we used all geotagged tweets in the UK between the 20^th^ August
until the 28^th^ August, providing a window before and after the event to identify its
social media impact relative to the baseline.

The area of particular interest was the zone of the routes, shown in the figure below.
All tweets sent within this zone were filtered out from the national dataset and then
analysed.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
"/scr"
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
